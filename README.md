This was a fun project to write, dealing with Primereact for the first time was little time consuming, I had to go through the documentation.
This is a calendar app built using React and NodeJS.
This app can add meetings delete meetings. You can add time, date, day, duration, description of the meeting.
For the front end I have used react, MDBootstrap, Primereact, Primeflex. Backend was written using ExpressJS

This app is accessed through password verification, credentials are mentioned below

EMail - `admin@example.com`
Password - `password`

I have used MDBootstrap for the Login page for experimental purpose, rest of the app uses Primereact and Primeflex.
Click on the logout button to logout of the application.

This app does not have the option to modify the meetings event though the buttons are present ( future integration).
Thank you.
